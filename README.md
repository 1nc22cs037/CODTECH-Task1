Overview of the Project

Project:"SIMPLE CALCULATOR"

The objective of this program is to build a basic understanding of fundamental programming concepts in Java, such as:

1. User Input Handling: Using the Scanner class to capture user input.


2. Control Flow: Utilizing conditional statements (specifically, a switch statement) to perform different actions based on user input.


3. Arithmetic Operations: Performing basic arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on user-provided values.


4. Error Handling: Implementing a simple check to avoid division by zero, which introduces basic error handling.


5. Output Display: Displaying results to the user to improve understanding of input-output operations.



This project serves as an introduction to interactive Java applications and encourages good programming practices, such as closing resources (scanner.close()), validating input, and providing user feedback.
